# Project Setup
First of all set a project in firebase. then created a web app in firebase project. From that web app I took the firebaseConfig variable and brought it into the firebaseInit file inside firebase folder.

1 = here I don't need all of the firebase services. I just need the app services. that's why i imported only the app service.
2 = here I imported the firestore service.
3 = initialized firebase app
4 = firebase timestamp. now i may not understand what is the timestamp, but later he will explain.
