# Project Setup
First of all set a project in firebase. then created a web app in firebase project. From that web app I took the firebaseConfig variable and brought it into the firebaseInit file inside firebase folder.

1 = here I don't need all of the firebase services. I just need the app services. that's why i imported only the app service.

2 = here I imported the firestore service.

3 = initialized firebase app

4 = firebase timestamp. now i may not understand what is the timestamp, but later he will explain.

# Navigation
in this part i am gonna add navigation for desktop and mobile.

5 = gave name to the 'to' attribute so that i can change the url whenever i want.

6 = vue-svg-loader dependency makes it possible to use svg images like vue components. to use the dependency a configuration file is included called "vue.config.js"

7, 8, 9 = [Vue Transition in official website](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Transition-Classes)
